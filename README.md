# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
We have been given two data sets containing ride-share data from a specific company. One data set contains city names, how many ride-share drivers are in that city, and if the city is urban, rural, or suburban. The second data set contains data about specific rides. This includes the city, date, fare, and ride-id. We have been tasked with first creating a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. The second task is to create a multi-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type during a specific time frame.

## Results
For reference, here is an image of the summary data: (https://github.com/azarowj/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Summary%20Data.png)

Here is an image of the multi-line graph: (https://github.com/azarowj/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/PyBer_fare_summary.png)

From the data summary, we can see that total rides increase from rural to suburban to urban, and that total drivers as well as total fares both follow this pattern. However, average fare per ride and average fare per driver follow the reverse pattern.
The multi-line chart shows us that sometimes the different city types follow the same trends, but other times they don't. For example, all three are experience a dip the first week of January and mid-March. All three also experience a spike at the end of February. However, in early April urban cities are still in a spike while suburban and rural cities are in a dip.


## Summary
I have a few recommendations to make to the CEO based on the previous data. I would move some drivers from urban cities to rural cities in order to create less of a disparity in the average fare per driver. Having a $19 difference in favor of rural drivers in the average fare per driver over urban drivers is discouraging. In early April, I would shift some of my rural and suburban drivers to urban cities to help make up for the spike in demand in the urban cities. This would not sacrifice service to the suburban and rural cities as they are in a dip during that time of year. At the end of Apri, I would move some of my urban drivers to suburban ciites as urban cities experience a dip in fares and suburban cities experience a large spike.
